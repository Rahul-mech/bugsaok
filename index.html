    <h1>CROSS-SERVER ISSUES:</h1>
    
    <p>There are many bugs when we cross the server. Last time I (<strong>VIVOW</strong>) went to loot resources from my farm and faced the following issues:</p>
    
    <p>
        <span class="issue">Issue 1:</span> When we go to another kingdom, the game starts lagging. It doesn’t open for a long time and says that the server is under maintenance. The respective screenshot is provided below:

    <p>
        <span class="issue">Issue 2:</span> When I went to Kingdom 2021 (K2021) using my farm in Kingdom 63 (K63), the player from K2021 wasn’t able to attack me. They could send only two marches at once, and when they tried to send a third march, it showed an "Invalid Operation" error. This makes it more complicated to loot resources from other kingdoms. The respective video proof of the issue is provided below:

        <span class="issue">Issue 3:</span>We get zero loot of resources when we send more than 8 to 9 million troops. Troops return with no resources even after attacking farms. The respective screenshot is provided below:
